Three months have passed since the first {announcement}[announcement], and we're
finally ready to release Hibernate Reactive 1.0.

Hibernate Reactive is a reactive API for Hibernate ORM, which supports non-blocking
database clients and reactive programming as a paradigm for interacting with the
relational database. This release supports the full feature set of JPA, along with
almost the whole feature set of Hibernate ORM core, including an impressive array of
features for achieving high performance data access.

Hibernate Reactive 1.0 supports the following databases:

- PostgreSQL 13
- MySQL 8
- MariaDB 10
- Db2 11.5
- CockroachDB 20.2

Hibernate Reactive works well in {vertx}[Vert.x] and {Quarkus}[Quarkus]. In
particular, it's a perfect partner for {rer}[RestEASY Reactive]. In these reactive
environments, our performance tests show Hibernate Reactive matching and sometimes
outperforming more traditional data access layers which use blocking IO to interact
with the database.

Like Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Reactive gives you the choice of writing your data
access layer using machine-generated SQL, handwritten SQL, or a mix of both. For
users who dislike JPA's model of stateful persistence contexts, or when this model
is an imperfect match to the performance requirements of a particular transaction,
Hibernate provides an alternative programming model based on
{stateless}[stateless sessions]. When it comes time to tune performance, Hibernate
Reactive lets you easily take advantage of {cache}[caching] and {batch}[batching],
and provides flexible strategies for tuning {fetch}[association fetching].

Hibernate ORM provides a wealth of features which go beyond the JPA specification,
and almost all of these are now supported in Hibernate Reactive. For convenience,
we've listed some of the {annotations}[most commonly-used mapping annotations].

You can find more information on the {Hibernate Reactive}[Hibernate website].
